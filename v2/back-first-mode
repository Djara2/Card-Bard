backside of card 1, add card to revisit buffer
backside of card 2, add card to revisit buffer
backside of card 3, no alternate answers, so do not add to revisit buffer
.
.
.
all cards visited

alternate answer of card 1 in revisit buffer, keep in revisit buffer (card 1 has more alternate answers)
alternate answer of card 2 in revisit buffer, remove from revisit buffer (card 2 does not have more alternate answers)
.
.
.
done when no cards in the revisit buffer have alternate answers

keep a round counter to know which alternate answers buffer index to be checking
if the size of the alternate answers buffer is smaller than the round counter, it can be skipped

-> now the revisit buffer is not even needed
